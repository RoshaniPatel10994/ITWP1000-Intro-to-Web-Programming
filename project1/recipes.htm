		<h2>My Interest in Vegetarianism</h2>

			Below I linked a few recipes that are perfect for anyone from YouTube. The first recipe is a mango smoothie. 
			Very simple, the ingredients are very simple (mangos, bananas, milk and vanilla yogurt). 
			This is one of my favorite foods and is perfect for everyone. If the fruit is ripe it will not only be easy to digest, 
			but also very delicious as the fruit is sweet and perfect. The milk and yogurt add a little bit of protein. I think this 
			can be a very easy breakfast or lunch and very nutritious and healthy.  People do not see smoothies as food, rather a snack. 
			But the nutrition profile is probably better than the types of food most people eat and it is very well digested which is important.

			The second recipe is a falafel recipe. It is not the most healthiest recipe as its fried in oil. But I think people sometimes need to live a little. Thus I chose this recipe. 
			The falafel is very addicting and very tasty. It can be combined with anything. You can make it into a falafel patty that can be used as a meat substitute in burgers. You can make 
			burritos out of it (replacing the beans/beef), a simple veggie wrap or even a pita! The combinations are endless. I personally like to add salsa, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, banana peppers, 
			tahini, hummus, yogurt to mine and it simply tastes amazing. I think this is a great recipe for anyone to learn.
