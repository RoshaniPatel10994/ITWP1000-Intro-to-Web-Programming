		<h2>My Interest in Vegetarianism</h2>

			Below I linked a few recipes that are perfect for anyone from YouTube. The first recipe is a mango smoothie. 
			Very simple, the ingredients are very simple (mangos, bananas, milk and vanilla yogurt). 
			This is one of my favorite foods and is perfect for everyone. If the fruit is ripe it will not only be easy to digest, 
			but also very delicious as the fruit is sweet and perfect. The milk and yogurt add a little bit of protein. I think this 
			can be a very easy breakfast or lunch and very nutritious and healthy.  People do not see smoothies as food, rather a snack. 
			But the nutrition profile is probably better than the types of food most people eat and it is very well digested which is important.

			The second recipe is actually two recipes first a falafel recipe and than a vegetable manchurian recipe. I thought I'd group these together to show off my web design skills. They are not the most healthiest recipes as they are fried in oil. But I think people sometimes need to live a little. Thus I chose these recipes. 
			Both are very addicting and very tasty. You can make both into a patty that can be used as a meat substitute in burgers. You can make 
			burritos out of them(replacing the beans/beef), a simple veggie wrap or even a pita! The combinations are endless. I personally like to add salsa, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, banana peppers, 
			tahini, hummus, yogurt to both the fried portions of these recipes and they simply tastes amazing. I think these are great recipes for anyone to learn.
