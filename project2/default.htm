		<h2>My Interest in Vegetarianism</h2>
		
		<p>Welcome to my homepage for ITWP 1000. My name is Roshani Patel and this is my project website I created. 
		As you can tell we have to choose a topic. My topic will be about animals and how to treat them well. 
		I think animals are amazing and very intelligent. They have the same feelings/thoughts and emotions as humans and I think they are our equals. 
		This website discusses the benefits of going vegetarian, how to help animals (save their lives) and gives some facts about animals that are vegetarian. 
		I am not trying to force my beliefs on you. This is just a website that states my opinion and some facts. 
		You are free to do whatever you want. This is for information only.</p>
		
		<p>I hope you enjoy my website. This is my first website I have created. It is not perfect, but you will find several navigational links to other pages on my website. 
		The pages have some content I found that I think you will find interesting. There are pictures, a YouTube Video and sounds. I did my best to format the website so its enjoyable. I hope you will learn something. 
		I learned a lot while making this website and I hope you will learn about topics important to me in this website. Thank you so much for stopping by and I hope you have a great day!
		</p>
