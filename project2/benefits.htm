		<h2>My Interest in Vegetarianism</h2>
		
		<p>I am really interested in health and nutrition. I do not think any diet is perfect, but I think a vegetarian not fully vegan diet is suitable for most people. Vegetarian means you can still eat dairy product which I think is not perfect, but required. I think as long as animals are treated well, you can drink dairy. All around the world there is an obesity problem. People avoid carbohydrates and now only eat protein and fat because they think its healthy. The “paleo” diets are very popular. I think in the long term this is not very good because human need carbohydrate to survive (check any Biology book and it will say the main source of cellular energy is carbohydrate).</p>
		
		<p>Vegetarian diet is a good source of carbohydrate and protein (with milk). The protein is a perfect protein and with a good source of carbohydrate like ripe fruit goes perfect with milk. Fructose is a sugar found mainly in fruit, in the studies shown below you can see it catalyzes glucose oxidation and increases body temperature. If you check any biochemistry book, you will see that fat can be made from sugars, but sugars cannot be made from fat. They can only be made from protein (gluconeogenesis). Thus if you eat too much protein, some of it will be converted to sugar and oxidized for energy which can be inefficient. Keeping your intake of sugars high ensures the protein is used to build structure.
