		<h2>Save The Animals</h2>
		
		<p>
			I think its important to protect animals and this is the main reason for this website. Going vegetarian is very important as billions 
			of animals are killed every year so we can survive. This is a tremendous burden not only on natural resources but also on entire economies 
			and the planet. Not to mention billions of animals who live their lives in factory farms.
		</p>

		<p>
			Animals are just like us, they have their own language in which they communicate (which even our experts do not know about!). 
			They also feel emotion (your dog is happy when you come home and animals remembering their owners after decades!) and are sentient 
			beings just like us. They share this Earth with us and they have their homes just like we have ours. 
			They are of course not perfect, but no one is. We need to protect their habitat. 
			You would not like anyone coming into your home would you? 
			Would you not be scared of a more advanced civilization using your body for things you do not want it to be used for? 
			Think of it in that manner.
		</p>

		<p>
			For others we have to realize that Earthâ€™s population is over 7.5 billion people now. If each of those people ate like people in the developed world, 
			there would not be enough farmland to feed us. I think simply limiting animal food consumption to just dairy would meet all nutritional needs and be a lot
			more efficient than raising billions of animals all of which need several times their body weight in food which in turns requires a lot of trees to be cut
			down, lots of habitats destroyed, chemicals sprayed on the land (and thus get into our water!) and entire ecosystems destroyed.
		</p>

		<p>
			Finally I think vegetarian food can taste as good if not better than animal based foods. Look at the success of the Beyond Burger and Impossible Foods and you will see where our future lies.
			</p>

			Again thank you for your time. Here are some sounds of an Elephant which is my favorite animals. It is also vegan and one of the largest land animals.
